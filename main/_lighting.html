		The lighting in and around your home is very important. It’s more than a utilitarian consideration. Your home’s lights do more than just illuminate your dining room or help you find your way in from the patio. Your home’s lighting is responsible for each room's atmosphere, for creating the environment you enjoy while eating with your family or watching a movie. However, many homes suffer from poor design issues when it comes to the lighting used indoors and outdoors on the property. Tesla Solutions can offer lighting consultation and design services, as well as installation and much more.

		What’s Possible?

		Many homeowners do not realize just what is possible with home lighting. While customizing the style and type of light fixtures is common, there’s much more that can be done. Tesla Solutions can provide you with a range of different options.</br></br>
Our first step will be to conduct a lighting consultation to determine what your needs are in terms of outdoor/indoor lighting. This consultation will include several different steps, including determining what rooms are most frequently used, what your indoor and outdoor lighting usage is on a regular basis and how to provide you with the level of control necessary. </br></br>
One option that we recommend is the use of LED lighting. LEDs offer immense reduction in power consumption and don’t sacrifice illumination. LEDs also provide substantial gains in terms of bulb life. For instance, a standard incandescent bulb lasts about 1,000 hours. Newer compact fluorescent bulbs have a lifespan of about 8,000 hours. LEDs, on the other hand, can last up to 30,000 hours or more. Numerous new light fixtures are available on the market that utilize advanced LED technology and provide you with the aesthetics that need for your home.</br></br>
Additionally, LEDs are more earth-friendly. Unlike compact fluorescents, LEDs have no mercury in them and pose no threat to the planet. Finally, LEDs can be used as both indoor and outdoor lighting, and Tesla Solutions provides advice, planning and installation service for all your lighting needs.</br></br>
Anything is possible with our custom lighting control solutions. It all begins with an energy management consultation, during which our licensed contractors will listen to your needs, inspect your property and make recommendations on what should be changed or added to help you achieve your goals.</br></br>
