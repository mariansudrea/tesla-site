	Energy bills are incredibly high today, and are only getting higher. Energy savings are becoming increasingly more important. Saving on energy consumption is hard to do, though. Homeowners and business owners can take some steps on their own, certainly. For instance, setting the thermostat higher in the summer and lower in the winter can help reduce utility costs. Switching to compact fluorescent bulbs can help as well. However, there are better options and Tesla Solutions can help.
