		We work with PG&E or your local energy company to provide you with the most efficient solutions for your home. In addition to the monthly bill savings provided by our upgrades, PG&E provides direct rebates and loans to help you with the initial purchase. More information about PG&E rebates and assistance programs can be found on their site.</br></br>

	Additional rebates are available for HOA's who choose to upgrade to more energy-efficient fixtures for outdoor lighting, laundry rooms and other shared facilities.</br></br>

	Cities that provide their own power, like Santa Clara or Palo Alto, provide even more rebates to upgrade your home to reduce power use, and our licensed technicians can help you through the process of pre-inspection and approval from your local power supplier.
