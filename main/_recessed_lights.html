		Recessed Lights	
	</div>
	<div class="textPcFull">
For a long time, recessed lights (also known as can lights or downlights) have remained a favorite choice for modern, streamlined lighting in kitchens, bathrooms, hallways, basements, and in commercial spaces. They are used for both accent and general lighting, and because they are relatively compact, they work wonderfully in small spaces.</br></br>

One of the latest types of recessed lighting to come on the market is LED recessed lights. They have all the same benefits of traditional downlights, but come with a few extra perks that only LEDs can provide.

		Benefits of LED Recessed Lighting
	</div>
	<div class="textPcFull">
		Whether you’re looking to install a new can or retrofit an existing fixture, there are four major advantages LED recessed lights have over older models.
	</div>
	<div class="sectionSubHeaderPc">
		LED Recessed Lighting Uses Less Energy
	</div>
	<div class="textPcFull">
		Folks realized the enormous energy savings LEDs can provide. For instance, LED Recessed Lighting use around 85% less energy than incandescent bulbs and 30% less than CFLs,. Moreover, they create little to no heat (i.e. lower cooling costs) and don’t contain any harmful chemicals (no special disposal requirements).

	<div class="sectionSubHeaderPc">
		High Quality Light
	</div>
	<div class="textPcFull">
		Unlike some other types of lights, LEDs don’t emit damaging infrared or ultraviolet lights. This is important if you are concerned with protecting the colors of fabrics, artworks, or retail inventory. You can illuminate your home or products in crisp, clean light and choose from a wide range of color temperatures to suit your preferences.

	<div class="sectionSubHeaderPc">
		Longer Life
	</div>
	<div class="textPcFull">
		Although, LED recessed lights tend to have a higher upfront cost than traditional can lights, they can last up to 25 times longer than incandescent. One LED light can last over a decade, which means you’ll waste far less money on replacement bulbs, and you can save yourself the inconvenience of regularly switching out bulbs in hard-to-reach locations.
	</div>
	<div class="sectionSubHeaderPc">
		Dimmable
	</div>
	<div class="textPcFull">
		Unlike some other energy efficient lighting options, LED recessed lights are completely dimmable and have no flickering. This feature is handy in both commercial and residential applications, as it’s an instant way to add mood, create different “zones” within a space, or save even more energy.
